### Introduction to Classical Machine Learning

Machine learning has now become one of the most important topics in the development organizations that are looking for advanced ways to take use of data to help the business gain a new level of understanding. Machine learning is a form of Artificial Intelligence that allows a system to learn from data instead of programming. Though, machine learning is not a simple process. It uses a variety of algorithms that repetitively learn from data to improve, describe data, and predict outcomes. A machine learning model is the output initiated when you prepare your machine learning algorithm with data. Machine learning is now essential for creating analytics models.

Iterative learning from data
Some machine learning models are online and continuously modifying .On the other hand offline machine learning models, are derived from machine learning algorithms but, once deployed, do not change. This iterative process of online models undergoes to an advancement in the types of connection that are made between data elements. Due to their size and complexity, these patterns and connections could have easily been overlooked by human observation. After a model has been prepared, these models can be used in real time to learn from data.

Big Data in Context with Machine Learning
Machine learning requires the correct set of data that can be implement to a learning process. The institution or an Organization does not have to have big data in order to use machine learning techniques; But, big data can help improve the accuracy of machine learning models. Now with big data, it is possible to assume data so that it can be stored in the most efficient and cost-effective manner .No technology transformation happens in inaccessibility; change happens when there is an arguable problem combined with the growing technology. There are immense examples of important technologies that have developed enough to support the new beginning of machine learning.

The Need to Understand and Trust your Data
Condition of accurate machine learning models is that it is necessary that the source data must be accurate and meaningful. Besides, these data sources are meaningful when combined with each other so that the model is accurate and trusted. In addition to trusting your data, it also important to perform data cleansing. Moreover Cleaning data means that you transform your data into a form that can be understood by a machine learning algorithm. For example, algorithms use numbers, but data is often in the form of words. You have to turn those words into numbers.

Data filtration gives the foundation for building analytical models that deliver results you can trust. The process of data filtration will help to ensure that your data is timely, clean, and well understood.

Leveraging the Power of Machine Learning
The role of analytics in an organization's operational processes has changed remarkably over the past 30 years. Companies are experiencing the development in analytics growth levels ranging from descriptive analytics(helps the analysts understand current reality in the business)to predictive analytics(helps predicting the changes based on understanding the pattern within the data) to machine learning. They are able to describe how various actions and events will affect the outcomes.


Approaches to Machine Learning -
Machine learning techniques are required to improve the perfection of predictive models. Depending on the nature of the problem being addressed, there are different approaches based on the type and volume of the data. Let's discuss the categories of machine learning.

### 1)Supervised learning


Supervised learning normally starts with an established set of data and a precise understanding of how that data is classified. Supervised learning is considered to find patterns in data that can be applied to an analytics process. This data has classified features that define the meaning of data. For example, Suppose there could be millions of images of flowers and it comprises with the explanation of what each flower is and then you can create a machine learning application that distinguishes one flower from another. By labeling this data about types of flowerss, you may have hundreds of groups of different types of flowers. Because the meaning of the data have been identified, it is well understood by the users so that it fits the details of the labels. When the label is continuous, it is a regression; when the data comes from a finite set of values, it known as classification. So regression used for supervised learning helps you to understand the connection between variables.
Supervised training models has application in variety of business problems, including fraud detection, speech recognition ,recommendation solutions or risk analysis.

### 2)Unsupervised learning


Unsupervised learning is best approach if the problem needs a vast amount of data that is unlabeled. For example, social media applications, such as Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram and so on all have large amounts of unspecified data. In order to understand the meaning behind this data it requires the algorithms that can help to understand the meaning based on being able to classify the data based on the patterns or clusters. Therefore, the supervised learning conducts an iterative process of analyzing data without human involvement. Unsupervised learning is used with email spam-detecting technology. Despite being a machine learning classifiers based on clustering and association it can also be applied in order to identify unwanted email.

Unsupervised learning algorithms divides data into groups of examples (clusters) or groups of features. The unlabeled data creates the parameter values and classification of the data. In result, this process adds labels to the data so that it becomes supervised. Unsupervised learning can determine the outcome when there is a massive amount of data. In this case, the developer doesn't know the context of the data being analyzed, so labeling isn't possible at this stage. Therefore, unsupervised learning can be used as the first step before passing the data to a supervised learning process. That's why, an unsupervised learning approach helps in determining the outcomes more quickly than a supervised learning approach.

### 3)Reinforcement learning


Reinforcement learning is a observable learning model. This algorithm receives feedback from the analysis of the data so the user is guided to the best outcome. Reinforcement learning is different from other types of supervised learning because in this system isn't trained with the sample data set but systems learns through trial and error. Therefore, successful decisions will result in the process being "reinforced" because it solves the problem at hand. Reinforcement learning is also the algorithm that is being used for self-driving cars we can say. In many method, training a self-driving car is extremely complex because there are so many potential obstacles. If all the cars on the road were self- sufficient, then the trial and error would be easier to overcome. One of the easiest ways to learn about reinforcement learning is that suppose the way an animal say dog is trained to take actions based on the profit/advantage. So if the dog gets a treat every time he sits on command, he will take this action each time.

### 4)Neural networks and deep learning


Deep learning is a method comes under the machine learning that includes neural networks in successive layers in order to learn from data in an iterative manner. Deep learning is especially useful when we are trying to learn patterns from indefinite data.
A neural network comprises of three or more layers: an input layer, one or many hidden layers, and an output layer. Data is taking in through the input layer. Then the data is revised in the hidden layer and the output layers based on the weights applied to these nodes. The typical neural network may consist of thousands or even millions of simple processing nodes that are densely interlinked to each other. The term deep learning is used when there are multiple hidden layers within a neural network. Deep learning is a machine learning technique that uses classified neural networks to learn from a combination of unsupervised and supervised algorithms. Deep learning is often called a 'sub-discipline' of machine learning.
